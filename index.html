    <h2>Welcome to Mr phenomenal Diaries</h2>
    <p>I'm a 21-year-old youngster who is passionate about Travelling and photography, In a single word I'm a Travel Photographer.</p>  
    <p>I'm phenomenally presenting u, The Best Travel Stories from my Motorcycle Diaries, trying to show u the world through my eyes with my striking words, stunning photographs and incredible videos. </p>
    <p>I'm trying to portray the Incredible  and True stories of different people and  places in  our country by exploring and exposing the unexplored parts of the country along with the tourist places , cause some places are named as tourist places but  they are not as good as I expected and some are not mentioned as tourist attractions  yet they are phenomenal in their own way . </p>
    <p>I will be focussing on the importance, values, and problems of the various cultures, Traditions and languages in our vast diversified country. </p>
    <p>I will be trying to find an answer about, how the Historical places turned to modern-day monuments? Even though the level of technology is high, why aren't we focused on leaving footprints of what we achieved in monument form as the kings did? </p>
    <p>I will be travelling to these places by classifying them into 6 categories </p>
    <ul>
    <li>Temples </li>
    <li>Historical </li>
    <li>Nature </li>
    <li>Religion & Culture & Traditions </li>
    <li>Food & Festivals </li>
    <li>Others </li>
    </ul>
    <p>I travel every place based on the above pattern, I plan according to the criteria of that place. </p>
    <p>Temples will be explored as architectural treat and changes occurred to them from history to modern day architecture, analysing their effect and influence on today's temples and beliefs </p>
    <p>How archaeological Places survived till today or did they ended up like letters in history books? </p>
    <p>How urbanisation affected the nature and animal life? </p>
    <p>How Do different religious people observe the traditions and cultures of other places? </p>
    <p>What are the prominent Festivals that are celebrated and why? </p>
    <p>What is the famous food available and why shouldn't we miss that food? </p>
    <p>Do the tourists or the locals care about each other? </p>
    <p>How do they understand each other despite the differences? </p>
    <p>Walk with me and I will show You the Incredible world at your finger tips , I will be shooting Point of view videos which will help u to see the beautiful places without actually going there , Phenomenal photos which will memorise you . </p>
    <p>So let's Get started with Journey with me and my Brother Royal Enfield classic 350 yes he's my brother which was given by my mother </p>
    <p>All I need is your love and support , </p>
    <p>For any questions or suggestions u can contact me </p>
